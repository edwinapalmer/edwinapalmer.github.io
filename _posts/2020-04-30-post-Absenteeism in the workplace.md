I decided to explore a dataset on absenteeism because I want to see what factors affect absenteeism from the workplace the most, and how it relates to the present-day situation the world is encountering with the COVID-19 epidemic.

While employers expect workers to miss a certain number of workdays each year, excessive absences can lead to decreased productivity which can have a major effect on company finances, morale, and other factors.
